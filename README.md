# UVA Research Insights Visualizations
This website contains several interactive visualizations, including scatterplots, density plots, and hexbin plots, to offer insights into research at UVA. The dataset consists of proposals, papers, and authors, and the intersection of the three. This site is still under revision and is subject to change.

## TO RUN:
Upload the json datafile provided into the repository on your local machine (the .gitignore will prevent it from uploading to github). Below is a picture of what a working webpage should look like.
